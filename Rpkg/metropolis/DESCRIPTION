Description: The `metropolis`` package is an instructional
    package for learning and using the Metropolis algorithm for Bayesian
    fitting of a generalized linear model. The package vignette includes
    examples of hand-coding a logistic model using several variants of the
    Metropolis algorithm. The package also contains prebuilt functions for
    simulating posterior distributions of Bayesian generalized linear
    model parameters using guided, adaptive, guided-adaptive and random
    walk Metropolis algorithms.
